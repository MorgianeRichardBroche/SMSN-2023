# Pedagogic Context

.pull-left[

.pink[**Transition to level 2 mathematics**]

  - abstract and formal
  - retention and progression issue for some
  - possibly exacerbated by COVID pandemic

  - including student in the design of the curriculum

  - benefits of doing and creating examples and counter-examples

# Linear Algebra Course

.green[**Could we use co-creation to help transition to level 2 mathematics courses?**]

--

.pull-left[

- Two linear algebra courses in year 2 at UoA: 
  - 35 registered students on semester 1 course: 75% in Natural and Computing Science degrees
  - 31 of those also took the semester 2 course

# Linear Algebra Course

- .green[Called for volunteers in semester 1 to work in January/Fberuary 2023 (between the 2 semesters) in small groups to:]
  - identified difficult linear algebra topics;
  - create tutorial style questions and problems on these topics;
  - code them in NUMBAS.
  
--

- .green[Intention was to collect feedback on experience of co-creation in groups:]
  - impact on motivation and confidence in linear algebra;
  - impact on marks.

# Experiment

.pink[Only one student came forward ...]

.pull-left[
The project ran between 02 February and 15 March 2023.

We met weekly to monitor progress and ran a focused interview on 15 March.

Interview conversation is analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).

# Focus Interview Results

.left[

.green[**A positive experience ...**]

 Improved motivation, focus and independence;
 
 Improved and consolidated understanding of linear algebra;
 
 Improved confidence in ability and confidence.
]

.right[
.pink[**... But some limitations**]

 Group work would have been nice: .pink[developing a community of learners];
 
 Activity should have run alongside the course.

# Future Plans

--

GMJT proposal with Emma Coutts for pair-work and for analysis of benfits of student-created examples for users.

--

Run the activity again alongside Linear Algebra I.

--

Investigate the possibility of organising similar activities for Analysis.
